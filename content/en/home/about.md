I am a mathematician interested in combinatorial optimization and machine learning. Since October 2021 I am an Associate Professor at 3IA, the Interdisciplinary Institute
of Artificial Intelligence of University Côte d’Azur. Before, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at I3S, Sophia Antipolis. Between 2014 and 2019 I was a researcher in the Mathematical & Algorithmic Sciences Lab from Paris Research Center, Huawei France. I obtained my Ph.D in Mathematics in 2015 from the University of Seville.
